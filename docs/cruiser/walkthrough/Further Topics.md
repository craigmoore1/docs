# Further Topics

This tutorial is not every feature you could want in an Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game. Because of that there is quite a bit of room for improvement. These topics are great for further exploration and learning. Here's some ideas to kickstart your own additions to the game:

1. Token wagers
2. Fees (take a percent of the wager or a fixed amount)
3. Allow queueing of moves
4. AI only version where the AI code must run on-chain
5. Early tie detection
6. 3rd party wagers
7. Data size optimizations (only need 18 bits for a mini board)
8. [Ultimate-Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://i.redd.it/iecrceevdlhz.jpg) (open rule questions here)
9. [5d Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe with Multiverse Time Travel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/) 
   * I have no idea how this would work since you don't have pieces to move, but it sounds really cool
   * If you are insane enough to do this then... good luck...
